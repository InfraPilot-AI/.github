# Modern Infrastructure Is Broken

Engineering teams are drowning in:

- Alert fatigue  
- Tool sprawl  
- Manual remediation  
- Security noise without context  
- High MTTR  
- Deployment risk  

Your stack might include:

Datadog. Prometheus. Grafana. Snyk. Wiz. Jenkins. GitHub Actions. PagerDuty. Slack.

Each tool works.  
Together, they don’t.

Incidents require switching between 6 dashboards.  
Security findings don’t explain impact.  
Deployments break production without immediate clarity.

Engineers spend 30–40% of time managing operations instead of building product.

# Meet AutonOps.ai

## Your AI-Native DevOps Control Plane

AutonOps connects to your infrastructure and continuously:

1. Collects telemetry from services and pipelines  
2. Correlates metrics, logs, deployments, and security events  
3. Detects anomalies and incidents  
4. Explains root cause using AI  
5. Recommends safe remediation  
6. Executes automation with approval guardrails  

This isn’t another dashboard.

It’s an operational intelligence layer above your entire stack.

# What You Get

## 🔎 Unified Operational Visibility

See everything in one place:

- Service health  
- Active incidents  
- Deployment activity  
- Security posture  
- Infrastructure metrics  

Live updates. No tab switching.

---

## 🚨 AI-Powered Incident Intelligence

When something breaks, AutonOps:

- Reconstructs the timeline  
- Correlates recent deployments  
- Analyzes logs and metrics  
- Generates root cause explanation  
- Suggests safest remediation path  

From alert → explanation → action.

Reduce MTTR dramatically.

---

## 🛡 Security That’s Actually Operational

Security findings without context are noise.

AutonOps connects vulnerabilities, runtime events, and misconfigurations directly to:

- Affected services  
- Production impact  
- Remediation steps  
- Automation workflows  

Security becomes actionable, not theoretical.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Awareness

AutonOps understands your CI/CD:

- Tracks deployments  
- Links changes to incidents  
- Enables safe rollbacks  
- Triggers pipelines  
- Identifies risky releases  

Ship faster. Break less.

---

## ⚙ Automation With Guardrails

Stop doing repetitive operational tasks manually.

Create runbooks that:

- Restart deployments  
- Scale services  
- Rollback releases  
- Notify teams  
- Require approval for production  

Automation that respects safety boundaries.

---

## 🤖 AI Copilot for DevOps

Ask:

- “Why did API latency spike?”  
- “What changed before this outage?”  
- “Is this deployment causing errors?”  
- “What’s the safest rollback plan?”  

AutonOps analyzes:

- Metrics  
- Logs  
- Security findings  
- Deployment history  
- Infrastructure state  

And gives structured, decision-ready answers.

# Why AutonOps Wins

Traditional tools show you data.

AutonOps gives you:

- Context  
- Correlation  
- Explanation  
- Action  

It transforms operations from reactive to intelligent.

From monitoring to autonomy.

# The Future of DevOps

We believe infrastructure should:

- Diagnose itself  
- Suggest the safest fix  
- Execute remediation within policy  
- Continuously enforce security  
- Reduce human toil  

Engineers shouldn’t babysit dashboards.

They should supervise autonomous systems.

AutonOps.ai is building the AI operating system for DevOps teams.
